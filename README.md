# September-Project

An incomplete project of mine. It was initially meant to be a 3D First-Person Perspective RPG however due to the ambitious scope and lack of time to work on it, it was abandoned. I might come back to it when I have the time.

As of the moment, it has a dialog system, a simple choice system (wherein you can choose to say yes or no or to accept or reject something), and two relatively simple quests.

The first quest tasks you with finding 3 mushrooms for a capsule NPC.
The second quest tasks you with delivering an item to another NPC however it turns out to be illegal goods and you have the choice to give it to the authorities or to be a drug mule or so to speak however only some parts of this quest was made.

This game also was made to be a low-poly style and as such there is a simple village that I have built using free assets I have found on the asset store. However the NPC's are just capsules at the moment.
